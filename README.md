# Toyota Corolla Car Price Predictor

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts the price of a **Toyota Corolla** based on its specifications. The app is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and **Linear Regression** from Scikit-learn for the backend model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle**. It contains details of various Toyota Corolla models such as:

- Model name
- Age
- Kilometer driven
- Fuel type
- Transmission
- HP, Doors, Gears, Weight, etc.

All categorical columns were converted to numerical using `LabelEncoder`, and the data was cleaned by removing outliers and irrelevant columns before training the model.
